'This application is a smart scholarship filter built for my friend Chud. When a user inserts a scholarship PDF, the app first runs an automatic check to filter out any obvious non-fits. It scans the document's text for a 'blocklist' of strings like 'female only,' 'STEM Major Only,' or 'Service Member only.'

If one of these strings is found, the PDF is sorted as 'Applicable.'

If none are found, it's sorted as 'Not applicable.'
